# Masculinity-Test
The Brain-Wiring Test This test is designed to indicate the masculinity or  femininity of your brain patterns. 
There are no right or wrong answers - the result is simply an indication of the 
probable level of male hormone your brain did, or did 
not, receive around six to eight weeks after your
conception. This is reflected in your preference of values, 
behaviours, style, orientations and choices.
